# 6070-CA05

CA-05

The purpose of this assignment is to create a KNN model that recommends 5 movies in a dataset based on a movie query. In this assignment, I tried to find 5 movies that best matched The Post. Before creating the algorithm, I made sure the data was clean by checking for null and duplicate values, then explored part of the data by visualizing the IMBD Ratings attribute. The dataset used only has 30 records and 10 attributes, so for the KNN recommender system I used algorithm = 'auto' and metric = 'minkowski'. 

To view this assignment, download the 6070_CA_05.ipynb file and upload it to JupyterLab or GoogleColab. To upload the file, go to the file icon on either JupyterLab or GoogleColab and press the Upload arrow icon. Select the 6070_CA_05.ipynb file that you had previously downloaded and upload it. If on GoogleColab, go to the File tab to the right of the CO orange symbol, go to Open Notebook, go to Upload, and select the 6070_CA_05.ipynb file. If on JupyterLab, double click that file and see it pop up. Click either Run or Runtime and Run All Cells to run all of the code. Scroll from top to bottom to see my Decision Tree process. I have embetted headings and comments within the code so that it is more easily understood to the viewer.
